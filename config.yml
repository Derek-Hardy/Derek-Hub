      * My name is Derek, I am a software engineer at **Goldman Sachs**, living in Singapore as a permanent resident ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬
      
      * 
      
      * My current project specialises in a Raft-based, API-driven **distributed scheduling platform** for batch workflows (think of Apache Airflow) 
       that takes care of around 30 million firmwide job executions daily
      
      *
      
      * Previously, I worked on the infrastructure supporting global Ad Network at **ByteDance**, making App monetization easy and accessible to all developers globally (BTW, the platform is called **Pangle**)
