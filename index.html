            </div>
            <p >
                I graduated from <b>National University of Singapore</b> in 2021 with a bachelor degree in <b>Computer Science</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then, I have been working on the advertisement delivery system at <b>ByteDance Singapore</b> as a software engineer.

            </div>
            <p>
                During my undergrad years, I had internships at several other cool places:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Tencent</b>: worked on the near real-time data processing pipepline for their ads system</li>
              <li><b>Goldman Sachs</b>: worked on optimising resource traffic for the internal developer platform</li>
              <li><b>Visa</b>: worked on automating test flow for their fraud detection system</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I was also a developer/maintainer of this open-sourced peer evaluation platform called <a href="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates">TEAMMATES</a>. It has an active user base across the globe, primarily university instructors and their students.
                <br><br>
                In the years to come, I am keen to improve my hands-on skills in software engineering on and off the work, move fast and expand my technical scope further.
                <br><br>
                Since 2017, I had the chance to live and study in Switzerland and Germany. It's exciting to learn from and work with a diverse group of bright minds.
                It was also cool to observe how does technology impact different parts of the world. And how different countries respond to those changes.
                <br><br>
                I have also travelled to Czech Republic and England. They are amazing places that I can't wait to visit for a second time.
