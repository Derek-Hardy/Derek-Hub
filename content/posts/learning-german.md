title = 'YouTube channels I like for learning German'
+++

I took German as my first elective module back in my first year of university.

Honestly, I found it is a great opportunity to connect with people outside my faculty and from completely different cultural background.

And obviously I get to learn about German culture as well.

Again, I'm a practical person. I believe YouTube is a great place to get exposure to daily vocabulary, different accents and simply a real touch to local people.
So here are some great channels that I enjoy immensely while learning the language.

### [Easy German](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbxb2fqe9oNgglAoYqsYOtQ)

The team has made the language fun to follow.

I found their street interview series exceptionally helpful in learning everyday vocabulary.

The topics chosen are diverse and down to earth. It is interesting to hear different accents and mindsets.

There is also Spotify podcasts available to listen anywhere and anytime.

### [Let's Cook mit Julian](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9BFhq0gy7xWCIouULbQU7g)

I really like to try out awesome food and, if time permits, cooking! 

So this channel is always fun for me to sit back, watch and relax. And I won't ever get lost in the supermarket anymore :)

Julian had a really cool taste and recipe. 

### [Lohnt sich das?](https://www.youtube.com/@Lohntsichdas)

The reason I'm so intriguing by travelling is to witness people's day-to-day life in other parts of the world. Sometimes they might look similar to what I'm experiencing, or sometimes completely different.

I liked the series of "Was verdient ein ..." *(how much does ... make)* that delves into modern daily life in Germany and how does a typical day look like for that profession. (one of my favourite reverse interview question as well ðŸ˜‰)
