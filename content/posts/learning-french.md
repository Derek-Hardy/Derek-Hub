+++

In my third year at university, I got the chance to experience the French part of Switzerland for a semester through an exchange program
at Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL).

I thought knowing a bit of the language would definitely boost my experience there, so I decided to take a French module at my home university.

Well, I ended up loving it. There are a few channels that really helped me out with daily conversations.

### [Francais avec Pierre](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVgW9ZQaGBk6fsiPgE2mYDg)

A channel run by a couple. It provides extensive learning materials to master French language.

They explain many grammatical concepts in detail and show many awesome aspects of French culture. 

The expressions and speed are always beginner-friendly.

### [Francais avec Nelly](https://www.youtube.com/@francaisavecnelly)

Nelly focuses a lot on the day-to-day activities, and introduces what kind of conversations to expect in practical situations.

Her videos are super effective for me to pick up useful phrases and vocabulary that are exactly missed from the classical textbook.

Like, nobody will ever ask about my uncle, grandpa, sister-in-law blah blah in every language... right?

A French professor lived in Poland. He gives very good advice and recommendations on learning French.

He also produces great podcasts for listening practice over a wide range of topics.
