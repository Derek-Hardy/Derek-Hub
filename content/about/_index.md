## About me 🧑🏻‍💻

I have been mostly hacking in **Golang** and **Java**, and appreciate both functional & object-oriented programming paradigms to solve real world engineering problems.

Right now I'm a three-year experienced software engineer @ **Goldman Sachs**, focusing on building the firm's distributed scheduling platform for batch workflows.

```text
What is a scheduling platform?

It is responsible for managing the dependency graphs among predefined jobs 
and their executions at the specified time and on the specified compute resources.
```

and then

```text
What is batch workflow?

It is the execution of a series of tasks in a predefined sequence without 
manual intervention, which usually processes a large volume of data
```

🤔 For example, a trading desk wants to start processing today's trading activities for some of their assets after the market close. They can set up:
* `Job_A` that triggers the post-trade application to start at 4:00pm local time to reconcile and generate transaction reports; or it can be individual job `Job_A1`, `Job_A2`, `Job_A3` for each asset class 
* `Job_B` that depends on all `Job_A1`, `Job_A2`, `Job_A3` to complete, before it starts aggregating all reports into central statistics
* `Job_C` that starts after `Job_B`'s completion to generate and submit regulatory reporting

```text
The dependency graph:

4:00pm EST ⏰
           | Job_A1 ————\
           | Job_A2 —————> Job_B ——> Job_C ——> done!
           | Job_A3 ————/
```

When realised that this workflow might be the same for tomorrow as well, you can set up recurrence for it on the platform using 
**cron** feature based on your custom schedule (e.g. trigger the above workflow every weekday, excluding bank holidays).

Of course, this is a simple example to illustrate the idea. There are more demanding scheduling requirements that the team is actively working on,
including but not limited to:

* what if the job generates huge amount of logs that put pressures on the allocated host;
* how to optimise for throughput if there are 100 thousand of such `Job_A1`...`Job_A100000`need to launch at the same time;
* noisy neighbour problem when jobs interfere with each other on the shared host resource

Earlier on, I used Golang & Gin HTTP framework quite extensively to build and optimise REST APIs for the Ad Network infrastructure @ **ByteDance**.

There is a lot of work involved to communicate and coordinate with different teams around the world to make Ads delivery effective:
* need **geolocation** targeting support to recommend right contents for the right region
* need to collect signals from the request context for **machine learning** model to produce more accurate personalisation
* need to infer user profile from the request context in order to make ads delivery compliant with local regulations

All happen within one HTTP round trip under 1 second organised behind the scene as a directed acyclic graph.

Didn't really consider a master degree right now, because I felt I am more used to a top-down approach where I come across a real world problem
and try to break it down to fundamentals. 

Plus, I'm already surrounded by many interesting CS problems, peers and seniors in my day-to-day work that are worth spending time with.
