## About me 🧑🏻‍💻

I'm Derek and I live in Singapore for the past 12 years.

Right now I'm a 3-year experienced software engineer at **Goldman Sachs**, focusing on distributed system and job scheduling platform (think of [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)).

I also used to build and maintain high performing APIs in global advertising platform at TikTok called [Pangle](https://www.pangleglobal.com/).

Even before, I built stateful data processing pipeline with [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) as part of the core user recommendation system at Tencent Ads.

I have been mostly hacking in **Golang** and Java, and appreciate both functional & object-oriented programming paradigms to solve real world problems.

Flash back further to the past, I studied Computer Science at **National University of Singapore**, from 2017 to 2021, and received my bachelor degree there.

Even until now, I liked my choice and enjoyed my diverse experiences in that 4 years, including but not limited to:

> 1 - Cool software engineer internship at Tencent headquarter in Shenzhen
>
> I met a great mentor and fellow interns. More importantly, the work assures me that I like things hands-on and building a career in software is the way to go for me.

> 2 - Exchange study at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland in my third year
>
> It was an incredible semester focusing on coding and research topics in Machine Learning alongside the quiet Lake Leman.

> 3 - Software engineer internship at content delivery team in Goldman Sachs
>
> This was my very first hands-on experience with distributed system. I found it is one of those intriguing problem spaces to explore.

Didn't really consider a master degree right now, because I felt I'm already surrounded by many interesting CS problems in my day-to-day work that are worth spending time to focus on.
