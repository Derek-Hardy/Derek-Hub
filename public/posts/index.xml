      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my third year at university, I got the chance to experience the French part of Switzerland for a semester through an exchange program
at Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought knowing a bit of the language would definitely boost my experience there, so I decided to take a French module at my home university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I ended up loving it. There are a few channels that really helped me out with daily conversations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took German as my first elective module back in my first year of university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I found it is a great opportunity to connect with people outside my faculty and from completely different cultural background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And obviously I get to learn about German culture as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I&amp;rsquo;m a practical person. I believe YouTube is a great place to get exposure to daily vocabulary, different accents and simply a real touch to local people.
So here are some great channels that I enjoy immensely while learning the language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
