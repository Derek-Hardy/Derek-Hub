      <title>Common Go channel uses</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Go is known for its native support for concurrency. You can easily spin up a concurrent execution (i.e. goroutine) using keyword &lt;code&gt;go&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is similar to OS thread but managed by Go runtime scheduler instead of OS kernel. The underlying implementation actually employs an M:N model to multiplex M goroutines onto N threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the great power of concurrency comes with the responsibility to handle synchronisation in the right manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Built-in functions in Go</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/go-built-in/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The builtins are functions in Golang that you can call directly &lt;em&gt;without having to import any package&lt;/em&gt;; they just come with the programming language itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full list resides in the builtin standard library: &lt;code&gt;https://pkg.go.dev/builtin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the builtin functions are widely used, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to know them by heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motivation for this post comes from the fact that &lt;code&gt;Go 1.21.0&lt;/code&gt; has introduced multiple new handy builtins (which doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen frequently).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>YouTube channels I like for learning French</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my third year at university, I got the chance to experience the French part of Switzerland for a semester through an exchange program
at Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought knowing a bit of the language would definitely boost my experience there, so I decided to take a French module at my home university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I ended up loving it. There are a few channels that really helped me out with daily conversations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>YouTube channels I like for learning German</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took German as my first elective module back in my first year of university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I found it is a great opportunity to connect with people outside my faculty and from completely different cultural background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And obviously I get to learn about German culture as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I&amp;rsquo;m a practical person. I believe YouTube is a great place to get exposure to daily vocabulary, different accents and simply a real touch to local people.
So here are some great channels that I enjoy immensely while learning the language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
