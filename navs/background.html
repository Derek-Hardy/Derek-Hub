                I studied Computer Science course at National University of Singapore, from 2017 to 2021, and received my bachelor degree there.

            <p>
                During the time, I have taken elective classes to learn German and French, and have also been an exchange student to EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm mainly interested in software engineering and distributed systems. Having worked at both tech and financial firms as a developer, I appreciate the real world application of computer science in both worlds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Until now, I have been most extensively programming in Golang and Java, with occasional Python in assisting me with data-related projects.

                I often do cardio exercises 2 or 3 times a week. I found it's a good way to keep me refreshed after all those sedentary office hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                I read at night or on weekends. Fictions, literatures and travelling are my top picks. I've constantly been exploring new ideas, such as <i>Flash Boys</i> talking about the advent and workings of high-frequency trading through stories on Wall Street.
