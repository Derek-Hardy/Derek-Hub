            <p>
                I am passionate about learning languages and always have an open mind to embrace cultures of people in other countries.
                <br><br>
                I believe YouTube is a great place to get exposure to spoken languages and practice listening.
                <br><br>
                Besides textbook, I always supplement my learning with great videos from local YouTubers that help me improve on the language skills.
                <br><br>
                Here I would like to recommend a bunch of great YouTubers by language.

                A very casual person who is passionate about teaching French in a fun way. He recently left
