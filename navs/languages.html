                I enjoy languages as much as programming. I constantly feel that acquiring a new language is like unlocking a new way to see the world.
                <br><br>
                I have taken German and French as part of my elective courses in university.
                From there, I had the opportunity to travel to Germany and Switzerland as an exchange student.
                I really enjoyed those memorable experiences and being with cool people that otherwise I would never be able to meet.
                <br><br>
                I believe YouTube is a great place to get exposure to daily vocabulary, different accents and simply a real touch to local people.
                Here are some great channels that I enjoy immensely while learning the language.

                The team has made the language fun to follow.
                Those street interviews are helpful in learning everyday vocabulary and topics.
                I also find it interesting to hear different accents and mindsets.
                There is also Spotify podcasts available to listen anywhere and anytime.

                Coming from computer science background, I feel it's cool and helpful to integrate language learning with my own major.
                I often listen to learn German and insights into technology at the same time.

                This is a more serious channel exclusively for German grammar. Peter is an awesome teacher and his courses are super clear and systematic.
                I usually set aside quality time on weekends to learn.

                It is a really cool knowledge sharing channel about extraterrestrial space. If you are also curious about
                the alien, blackhole and hypothetical technology, this is the site to go. The vocabulary is still difficult to me.
                There is also an English-version channel available.

                I have newly decided to wrap up the language journey with Japanese, because I really want to spend quality time

                Well... this one is a bit complicated. As a Chinese native speaker being fluent in English, I somehow found it easier
                and makes more sense for me to learn Japanese from Chinese. I did not yet find many YouTube channels that suit my learning style.
                For now, I am still exploring various textbooks and Chinese tutorials on Bilibili.
