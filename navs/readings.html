                I usually found reading is more enriching than browsing social media, although I do discover great recommendations
                through the Internet. For me, reading is a great way to switch my eyes away from monitors for a while.
                That often gives me a peace of mind, and restores energy for me to get back on coding works later.
                Here are some books I recently read and allowed me to realise something new.

                <i><b class="text-primary">Zero To One</b>, by Peter Thiel</i><br>
                I used to have some interactions with Palantir as a company. It left me with a rather positive impression.
                So I decided to know more about it through one of its founders. As a venture capitalist, Peter shared extensively
                on his unique insights into startups and technology landscapes across the globe.
                He often challenged conventional perceptions (or misperceptions), and that really blowed my mind.
                The book itself is actually quite thin (around 200 pages), but ideas within are so incredibly dense.
            </p>

                <i><b class="text-primary">Measure What Matters</b>, by John Doerr</i><br>
                An official guide to OKR (Objective and Key Results) system. John has narrated how he has brought an effective management tool from Intel to Google and gained
                phenomenal success over the last 20+ years. There are plenty of instructional and live examples on how to execute OKR in the right way.
                As a new grad whose first employer has followed such a system, I found this book incredibly useful for a systematic understanding.

                <i><b class="text-primary">Heart, Lifetime Advice from Inamori Kazuo</b> (《心，稻盛和夫的一生嘱托》)</i><br>
                As a sequel from "How to Live", this book stands at a more personal viewpoint. It advocates a personality
                of being thankful, kind and persistent. He reviewed some important parts of his life and shared about how to
                make the right decision in hard situations (work, family, leadership etc).
                More importantly, how to have such a mindset to continue doing that.

                <i><b class="text-primary">How to Live</b>, Inamori Kazuo (《活法》，稻盛和夫)</i><br>
                This is a great read on work ethics and attitudes. Inamori San has demonstrated from his own work experience how to keep up the motivation
                when working on something difficult or uninteresting. In the time of hardships, what is the right way to position ourselves
                and find opportunities within it. When running a business, what are some essential qualities that are so obvious but we often forget.
                Inamori San has shared extensively on his thoughts and practice from running 2 successful Japanese cooperates in the past decades.
                I believe it's even helpful to read again when we sometimes get lost in our work. This book has the potential to always bring us back on track.
