            <p>
                I am a voracious book reader since young. Here I want to share some good Computer Science
                related books that I read during my university. I like to take approaches to learn both from
                online tutorials and physical books to maximise my understanding.

                <i><b class="text-primary">Ng-Book 2: The Complete Book on Angular 2</b>, by Ari Lerner*</i><br>
                My reference book after completed official docs by Angular team.
                It surely deepens my familiarity with its various features through different use cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i><b class="text-primary">How Google works</b>, by Eric Schmidt & Jonathan Rosenberg</i><br>
                Nice book to get knowing the history of Google as a young and iconic company.
                The unique work culture and management at Google and its success in the technology field
                are the key takeaways and motivation for me.
            </p>

                <i><b class="text-primary">The Four</b>, by Scott Galloway</i><br>
                It shares a good insight of today's technology industry and how Apple, Facebook,
                Amazon and Google make themselves competitive and dominant. After reading, I am impressed
                with their business models and missions. Wishing I could be part of the team to
                make things happen.
            </p>

                <i><b class="text-primary">Architektur-und Entwurfsmuster der Softwaretechnik</b>, by Joachim Goll</i><br>
                A comprehensive book on software design patterns. I read in Chinese translated version.
                Diagrams and example code are excellent to aid in understanding to the practical use
                of each pattern. Since I have German language background, I also found the German naming
                in the source code are interesting and very relevant to the topics.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i><b class="text-primary">Data abstraction & problem solving with Java</b>, by Janet Prichard & Frank Carrano</i><br>
                My main data structure and algorithm book. It is good even for those who are not
                very familiar with Java language. Although the book itself is thick, the content is relatively
                concise to specific topics. Explanation is detailed and logical.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i><b class="text-primary">Thinking in Java</b>, by Bruce Eckel</i><br>
                A comprehensive book on Java programming language. Though I found the source code and context
                used to explain the feature are usually lengthy. Not an express way to learn Java
                but excellent as a revision book to refresh on the majority of Java features.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i><b class="text-primary">Pro git</b>, by Scott Chacon & Ben Straub</i><br>
                Another must-read to start on Git command line. It provides a complete guide on
                learning the version control system, which is indispensable in future project and work.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i><b class="text-primary">The C programming language</b>, by Brian Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie</i><br>
                It is an old but classic book on C. A must-read to kick start on the foundation of
                programming concepts, such as data type, function and pointer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i><b class="text-primary">Code</b>, by Charles Petzold</i><br>
                A super engaging book that guides me through the history of computer software and hardware.
                It answers questions like, why we need them? When they are useful? And how they work?
                I recommend it to all who wish to just know more about CS.
            </p>
